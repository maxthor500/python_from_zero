# python_from_zero 

* I already know Python and in this repository want record a path 
* This repository shows my solutions to the problems, and is therefore a collection of exercises in Python
## Studying and having fun in my free time.

Reading the "Python for Everyone" book, I decided to practice starting from the basics and solve the proposed algorithms by finding my own solutions.

## Leet Code 

My goal is to subtmit at least one problem per day on Leet Code and save the solutions in this repository.
